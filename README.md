# wordiply

This repository contains a replica of the Wordiply game from The Guardian newspaper, which my mother loves. This version allows you to play an unlimited number of times per day, unlike the original, where your number of daily games is limited to one. Also, in this version, "how good is your solution" is based on the dictionary and not on the answer of other users.
